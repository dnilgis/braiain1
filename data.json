This early network connected computers at different research institutions, allowing them to communicate and share resources. The 1980s saw the introduction of the Internet Protocol (IP), which enabled different networks to interconnect and form a single, global network.  As the internet expanded, it became more accessible to the general public. The World Wide Web, invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989, made it easy for people to access and share information using web browsers and hyperlinks. The 1990s saw a rapid growth in internet usage, with the widespread adoption of dial-up internet and the emergence of online services like America Online and CompuServe.  By 2030, the internet is expected to be even more pervasive and integrated into daily life, with the Internet of Things (IoT) connecting billions of devices and enabling new applications like smart homes and cities, and the internet will continue to shape and transform the way we live and work, with advancements in technologies like artificial intelligence and 5G networks, and it will be a fundamental part of our lives.",
