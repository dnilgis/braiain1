This initial network connected four nodes and paved the way for modern networking. In the 1980s, the Internet Protocol (IP) was developed, allowing different networks to communicate with each other.  The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, making it easy for people to access and share information using web browsers and hyperlinks. The internet expanded rapidly in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of dial-up internet and the emergence of online services like America Online and CompuServe. As broadband internet became more prevalent, online activities like streaming and social media became possible.  The internet will continue to evolve, with advancements in artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and 5G networks. By 2030, the internet will be even more integrated into daily life, with increased reliance on cloud computing and virtual reality, and it is likely that the internet will be an essential part of every aspect of life.",

The following decade marked the rise of the World Wide Web, developed by Tim Berners-Lee, which revolutionized access to information through web browsers. This ease of use spurred explosive growth, leading to the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, where countless websites emerged, and digital commerce began to flourish.
