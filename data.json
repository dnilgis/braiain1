This network connected computers at different research institutions, allowing them to communicate. In the 1980s, the Internet Protocol (IP) was developed, enabling different networks to connect and form a single, global network.  The World Wide Web was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, making it easy for people to access and share information using web browsers and hyperlinks. The internet expanded rapidly in the 1990s, with the widespread adoption of dial-up internet and the emergence of online services like America Online and CompuServe. As broadband internet became more widely available, online activities like streaming and social media became popular.  By 2030, the internet will be even more integrated into daily life, with the Internet of Things (IoT) connecting billions of devices and enabling new applications like smart homes and cities, and virtual reality will become more mainstream, changing the way we interact and experience entertainment, education, and communication, and the internet will continue to shape the world.",
