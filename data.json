In the 1980s, the Internet Protocol (IP) was developed, allowing different computer networks to communicate with each other and forming the basis of the modern internet.  The World Wide Web (WWW) was invented in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, revolutionizing the way people accessed and shared information online. The web made it easy for users to access and share information using web browsers and hyperlinks. The widespread adoption of the internet in the 1990s and 2000s transformed the way people communicated, worked, and accessed information. The rise of social media, e-commerce, and online services further transformed the internet into an essential part of modern life.  As the internet continues to evolve, it is expected to become even more integrated into daily life. The Internet of Things (IoT) will connect more devices and objects to the internet, making it easier to control and monitor various aspects of life.
